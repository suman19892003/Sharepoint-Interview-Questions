Q. In Powerautomate, From(Send as) Email option is avaialble for send email on behalf of another user apart from connection used in Outlook. But we need to create user in shared mailbox.
Go to admin center>Exchange admin center>Exchange>Under Receipients, select groups> Add Group > Manage Delegates > Add Delegate
It will givve 2 options of "Send as" and "Send on behalf", select both option
In powerautomate, we can use group name we created to send email from.It can send email to group of people added in group.

Add Created by as "Send as" in send an email action.it will send email from created by item user account.

Q. For debugging Prod solution in SPFX, We can use
Option 1:
Production bundles for SharePoint Framework solutions are minimized. Debugging the minimized code is never easy to point out the exact error.
Click “Pretty-print this minified file?” and it will transform the minimized ugly code into a pretty code.
Option 2:
Spin up your local development environment with: gulp serve --nobrowser
Append the following to the URL: ?loadSPFX=true&debugManifestsFile=https://localhost:4321/temp/manifests.js
Click on Load debug scripts
Doing it this way, you are actually loading the web part from your own local instance without impacting anyone else which is using it.

})

Q. Impact of giving end users provision to create a Team in MS Teams has a flow-on effect:
It creates an Office 365 Group with an associated SharePoint site
It creates an Exchange mailbox
It will (initially, unless this is changed) make the SharePoint site inaccessible to records managers.
It gets complicated if it is decided to delete the Team, SharePoint site, or Office 365 Group.
Note: It is recommended, in organisations rolling out MS Teams to end users, that the ability to create Office 365 Groups is disabled except for Global Admins

Q. How do I disconnect a SharePoint site from Office 365 group?
To delete a SharePoint site in Office 365, go to Settings>Site information. This will bring up an information panel with the option Delete site. If you are deleting a team site, then you will need to confirm that you want to delete the Office 365 group and the associated site. Then you click Delete and confirm.
    
Q. Difference between Teams and Channel?
When a Team is provisioned, a SharePoint site collection and Office 365 Group are created. Users have membership to this group, which allows them access to the SharePoint site collection. Think of SharePoint as a home and Office 365 Groups as the keys that unlock that house. In this analogy, channels would be the rooms in the home.
At the time of creating Team, it provides you option to create Public/Private Teams. Same applies with Channel it also provides you feature for public/private.

16. ULS Logs in SP Online?
There is no way to do it anymore in SP Online. The answers above may have worked previously, but Microsoft changed that so you need to contact them to get the required information.

17. Diff between team site and communication site?
18. What is dictributed cache ervice if deactivated in SP Online?
   We wouldn't stop this service. SharePoint use it in several ways:
   User profiles Updates go to cache; all servers then see this update.
   User authentication No more multiple logons when moving across Web Servers. All logon tokens are cached and reused across the farm.
   App authentication Caches Open Authorization (OAuth) tokens and prevents a need to return to ACS.
   Newsfeeds Caches the newsfeed items on team and My Sites.
   Security trimming Caches the security of newsfeed and profile activities.
   If you want to improve the speed of your server you may allocate less memory to the DCS using the Windows PowerShell Update-SPDistributedCacheSize cmdlet with the                CachceSizeInMB parameter.

19. Command to get all sitecollection and subsite in any environment.

    ForEach($Site in $SitesCollection) 
    { 
        Write-host -F Green $Site.Url 
        Try {
            #Connect to site collection
            Connect-PnPOnline -Url $Site.Url -Credentials $Cred

            $SubSites = Get-PnPSubWeb -Recurse
            ForEach ($web in $SubSites)
            {
                Write-host `t $Web.URL
            }
        }
        Catch {
            write-host -f Red "`tError:" $_.Exception.Message
        }
    }
}
Catch {
    write-host -f Red "Error:" $_.Exception.Message
}

20. how many days will site/subsite available after delete?
When you, as a global or SharePoint admin in Microsoft 365, delete a site (previously called a "site collection"), it's retained as a deleted site for 93 days.
Deleting these sites will delete the group and all its resources, including the Outlook mailbox and calendar, and any Teams channels.
Deleted Microsoft 365 groups are retained for only 30 days.
To reuse a URL from a deleted site (recreate a site), you need to permanently delete the site. After the site is permanently deleted, it might take up to 24 hours for the URL to become available.
deleting a site by using PowerShell, see Remove-SPOSite.
To permanently delete sites (including Microsoft 365 group-connected team sites) by using PowerShell,
Remove-SPODeletedSite -Identity https://contoso.sharepoint.com/sites/sitetoremove

Q. Manage large lists and libraries in SP Online?
You can store up to 30 million items or files in a list or library. Filtered views of large lists have a similar experience to other lists. However, when a list view shows more than 5000 items, you may run into a list view threshold error.

21. Overcome List view threshold in SP Online?
Edit the list view
If an error occurs when working with a large list, edit your list view.
The following four changes remove list view threshold errors. Make all four changes to remove all the errors.
a. Remove sorting for the list view
from both First sort by the column and Then sort by the column,select None.
Note: Columns with column types like people, lookup, or managed metadata can cause list view threshold errors when sorting. However, you can use text, number, date, and other column types in the first sort.
b. Remove grouping in edit view
From both First group by the column and Then group by the column,select None.
Other edits for the list view
c. For all columns in the Totals section, select None.

Q. Page Layout In SharePoint Online
Modern SharePoint pages can be configured with three different page layouts as,
Home Page Layout
Article Page Layout
Single Part App Page Layout
Home Page Layout
    Used by default on the site home page
    Used in the landing page of a modern site
    Page layout without the top-banner section (page title and header image)
Article Page Layout
    Used by default on the modern pages
    Page with the top-banner section
Single Part App Page Layout
    The page where the top-banner section is hidden
    Cannot be edited by end-users using browser (Command bar is hidden)
    Supports hosting only a single web part or Microsoft Teams application
Below is the PNP PowerShell script to change the Page Layout,
$SiteURL = "https://crescent.sharepoint.com/sites/knowledgehub"
$PageName = "Home.aspx"
$PageLayout = "Article" #Home, Article, SingleWebPartApp
 
#Connect to PnP Online
Connect-PnPOnline -Url $SiteURL -Interactive
 
#Set the Page Layout
Set-PnPPage -Identity $PageName -LayoutType $PageLayout
If you are using the Legacy PnP PowerShell module, use “Set-PnPClientSidePage” instead of “Set-PnPPage” cmdlet in the above script. My home page layout changed to an Article page with a banner:

Q. A user fills a form in a spfx webpart. I have to create an item in a list for this Metadata. What I would like to do is achieve this, but restrict the user from directly accessing/modifying items within the same list. But in client side web parts, code is able to do what user is able to do. Any suggestions how I could achieve impersonation and modify the list without providing user with the access to the list?
Both SharePoint Framework Extensions and user custom action or ECB menu item solutions run in the browser and can contain only client-side JavaScript code. Client-side solutions have a number of limitations, such as not being able to elevate permissions in SharePoint or reach out to external APIs that don't support cross-origin communication (CORS) or authentication using OAuth implicit flow. In such cases, the client-side solution could leverage a remote server-side API to perform the necessary operation and return the results to the client.
So, the option in this case is APP registration, and can add the scope of where only Admin ou User can access the application context.

60. Run with Elevated Priviledges in SPFX?
   SPFX Solution itself didn't support elevated permission using App-Only authentication, but with MS Flow (Power Automate), it's possible to use app-only elevated permission.
   App-Only Token and elevated permission is got in MS Flow and in SPFX solution only call the flow using httpClient object.
   Steps:
   A user does not have access to SharePoint list has been provided an Interface which is build using SPFx web part.
   A user makes an HTTP post request via SPFx web part which triggers MS flow.
   Next consecutive action present in the flow makes a request to ACS to retrieve Access Token.
   Once Action Token is received as a response another SharePoint REST API call has been performed using this action token.
   Item is created successfully

Actually ComponentDidMount() run once but it can run mutiple times.
componentDidMount() runs after the initial render only once
componentDidMount() may run multiple times if the component key prop value keeps changing
<ChildComp key={this.state.num} number={this.state.num} />
When you click the increment button, you will see following o/p. The child component's componentDidMount gets called again, if the state value of num changes in parent.
render() lifecycle 
componentDidMount() lifecycle 
render() lifecycle 
componentDidMount() lifecycle
You can either place your data fetch calls on an event listener, such as click. Or if you need to grab initial data when the component mounts, do it inside the componentDidMount() method.
Other lifecycles like, componentDidUpdate(), componentWillMount(), render(), can be triggered multiple times.

Delegation in Power Apps means process of retrieving data to the data source itself. This means Power Apps will retrieve small amount of data to make sure the performance is consistent.PowerApps enables the delegation of some operations to compatible data source called delegable functions.
Filter functions like Filter, LookUp and Search.
Sorting functions like Sort and SoryByColumns
Aggregating functions like Sum, Average, Min and Max
Table shaping functions like AddColumns, DropColumns, RenameColumns, and ShowColumns partially support delegation.

51. What are ways to create synchronous event in SPOnline like event handlers?
First Approach would be to create Azure function and attach to list
Second Approach is to create SharePoint Addins as mentioned below.
You can create provider hosted app to attach remote event receivers to artifacts in app web.
a. create provider hosted app . In the app web project add a list instance based on Contacts list definition
b. Now, if you right click on the Contacts list instance, you can add a Remote Event Receiver
c. You can add List events such as field added, or list deleted etc.
d. Once you click on Finish, visual studio will create and wire up the required web service end points. Notice that the remote endpoint is added to the remote web project. The list elements.xml will have the receiver information.
e. Based on the options selected, it will add two methods one is ProcessEvent which is a before event and the other is ProcessOneWayEvent which is an after event.
f. You can use the CSOM to make any changes in the event handler such as:
public SPRemoteEventResult ProcessEvent(SPRemoteEventProperties properties)
{
  SPRemoteEventResult result = new SPRemoteEventResult();
  if(properties.EventType == SPRemoteEventType.ItemAdding)
  {
     string firstName = Convert.ToString(properties.ItemEventProperties.AfterProperties["FirstName"]).ToLower();
     if (firstName.Contains("prashanth"))
     {
       result.Status = SPRemoteEventServiceStatus.CancelWithError;
       result.ErrorMessage = "My name already exists!";
     }

     result.ChangedItemProperties.Add("FirstName", firstName.ToUpper());
  }
  using (ClientContext clientContext = TokenHelper.CreateRemoteEventReceiverClientContext(properties))
  {
    if (clientContext != null)
    {
      clientContext.Load(clientContext.Web);
      //do something
      clientContext.ExecuteQuery();
    }
  }

  return result;
}

public void ProcessOneWayEvent(SPRemoteEventProperties properties)
{
  if (properties.EventType == SPRemoteEventType.ItemAdded)
  {
    string firstName = Convert.ToString(properties.ItemEventProperties.AfterProperties["FirstName"]);
    int listItemId = properties.ItemEventProperties.ListItemId;
    Guid listId = properties.ItemEventProperties.ListId;
    using (ClientContext clientContext = TokenHelper.CreateRemoteEventReceiverClientContext(properties))
    {
      if (clientContext != null)
      {
        Web web = clientContext.Web;
        SP.List list = web.Lists.GetById(listId);
        SP.ListItem item = list.GetItemById(listItemId);

        item["FirstNamePhonetic"] = firstName + " Phonetic";
        item.Update();
        clientContext.ExecuteQuery();
      }
     }
   }
   Note : When we try to debug the project, we’ll get a message that we cannot debug the remote event handler.To enable debugging, we can use the windows powershell window.

3. Filter, Search, and LookUp can be delegated.
Below are non delegable functon.
First, FirstN, Last, LastN
Choices
Concat
Collect, ClearCollect
CountIf, RemoveIf, UpdateIf
GroupBy, Ungroup

Note: For Non delegable function, it can bring record upto 500 which can be set to 2000.

4. UpdateIf can also be used in PowerApps to update values
UpdateIf( IceCream, Quantity > 175, { Quantity: Quantity + 10 } )

5. Patch for update existing record
Patch(
   LeaveRequests,
 Lookup(LeaveRequests,ID="THE ID You want to update"),
   {
   User:     DataCardValue6.Text,
   UserEmail:"suman@email.com"
})

6. Why we should state if we can use normal variable in React?
Updating state will make the component to re-render again, but local values are not.

In your case, you rendered that value in your component. That means, when the value is changed, the component should be re-rendered to show the updated value.

So it will be better to use useState than normal local value.

function Foo() {
    let a = 0;
    a = 1; // there will be no re-render.
    return <div>{a}</div>;
}

function Foo() {
    const [a, setA] = useState(0);
    if (a != 1) setA(1); // re-render required
    return <div>{a}</div>;
}

7. Modern team Site and comunication site diff?
a. Team Collaboration
When you want to create a place
where the members of a workgroup
or project team can collaborate on
project details, plan tasks; events or
exchange ideas, you want a team site.
When you want to broadcast news,
tell a story or share content for
viewing or showcase services or
people, you want a communication site.
b. A New Office Group will be created and coupled with the site. Sites are
Public by default in team site. 
But in comm site Office Group will not be created.
Sites are Private by default.
c. All members are content authors in the site who jointly create or edit the
content on site. In Comm site Few members are content authors
and a large number of members are
content readers or consumers.

8. For Modern UI, we can create a custom CSS style and inject the CSS on modern pages using SPFx extensions to achieve it.

9. While creating Team site collection from admin center, we get only 2 option for Privacy setting as Private and Public only. And it does not create SharePoint Group.
But When yu create Subsite inde this site collection of any template, it will create SP group for that subsite.

10. When we try to create group from admin center, we get 4 options as Microsoft 365,Distribution,Mail-enabled security,Security. Now while creating this group we also get option if we want to create team associated with this group and accordingly teams may or maynot be created.
If we wnat to add this group to our SharePoint we can add by "TestMS365Group Member" as our group name was only "TestMS365Group".

11. Get Subsites of a Site using PowerShell PnP
$SiteURL = "https://crescenttech.sharepoint.com"
 
#Get Credentials to connect
$Cred = Get-Credential
 
Try {
    #Connect to PNP Online
    Connect-PnPOnline -Url $SiteURL -Credentials $Cred
 
    #Get subsites in SharePoint Online using PnP PowerShell
    $WebsCollection = Get-PnPSubWebs -Recurse
 
    ForEach($Web in $WebsCollection)
    {
        Write-host $Web.Url
    }
}
catch {
    write-host "Error: $($_.Exception.Message)" -foregroundcolor Red
}

12. Get-PnPTenantSite //Returns all site collections

13. Get all site collection admin in all site collection
# Get the site collections  
$siteColl=Get-PnPTenantSite  
  
# Loop through the site collections  
foreach($site in $siteColl)  
{  
    write-host -ForegroundColor Green "Getting SCA from site: " $site.Url  
    Connect-PnPOnline -Url $site.Url -Credentials $credentials  
  
    # Get the site collection administrators  
    $scaColl=Get-PnPSiteCollectionAdmin   
    foreach($sca in $scaColl)  
    {          
        $sca  
    }  
}

14. Create New site collection
New-PnPTenantSite -Title Contoso -Url "https://tenant.sharepoint.com/sites/contoso" -Owner user@example.org -TimeZone 4 -Template STS#0

15. React Lifecycle
Mounting
These methods are called in the following order when an instance of a component is being created and inserted into the DOM:

constructor()
static getDerivedStateFromProps()
render()
componentDidMount()

Updating
An update can be caused by changes to props or state. These methods are called in the following order when a component is being re-rendered:

static getDerivedStateFromProps()
shouldComponentUpdate()
render()
getSnapshotBeforeUpdate()
componentDidUpdate()

Unmounting
This method is called when a component is being removed from the DOM:

componentWillUnmount()

16. For Error handling, we have
Error Handling
These methods are called when there is an error during rendering, in a lifecycle method, or in the constructor of any child component.

static getDerivedStateFromError()
componentDidCatch()

17. OnPremise gateway is used to fetch data from 

Remove duplicate data from SharePoint library.

18. SPFX lifecycle
1. OnInit method – This is the start method of the web part. It is suggested not to do much here, unless it is required by the webpart life cycle.
Use Case: Mostly this method could be used initiate environment level variables or global variables such as spcontext of PnPjs library.
2. ComponentWillMount – This method is called before the render method every time the control is loaded or refreshed.
Use cases: The code related to initial data pull for controls could be placed in this method. This is where the data feeds into required for dependency driven controls for eg. Web service and REST calls. It is advisable to show a loading message during this function run.
3. 3. ComponentDidMount – This method is called after the render method every time the control is loaded or refreshed. The code related to pre-population of controls could be placed here.
Use cases: This method is mostly used to load the state of the controls. Since React code is a state driven Framework, any state changes updates the controls with new changes but doing it here allows to set default values if needed before the state is updated for long running business rules.
4. ComponentDidUpdate – This method is called every time a Property or State is updated. Based on the update and if anything has changed, the implementation code could be run.
Use cases: In this method, we could check if a property or state has changed and act on the change.
5. Render method : This method is called to render the final HTML based on state change. We can include some switch logic or call html rendering functions.
Use cases: The use case is pretty simple for this one, reneder all the HTML on to the page.

19. Why we should state if we can use normal variable in React?
If you will use simple variable, You can click the button to increase the count, but the count value displayed in the component will never change.If you throw a breakpoint or add a console.log to increment(), you’d see that the method is indeed called and the value of this.count is incremented, but the component never reflects the change.
That’s because React components will only re-render when there are changes to props or state.Updating the class variable involves neither, so it does not trigger a re-render. This explains why the count changes in our example, but the displayed value never updates.

20. setstate and forceupdate difference?
The setState() function is typically used to update the component state with one or more new state properties. This is the typical way of mutating your state and managing view updates.
The forceUpdate() function is just a way to force a re-render of the component and its children in question. It does not mutate the state at all.
But You should avoid to use forceUpdate function.

21. this.domelement.queryselector('#mydiv').innerhtml=htmlstring;

22. SPFX get current user, this.props.context.get(this.props.siteurl+"/_api/SP.UserProfiles.PeopleManager/GetMyProperties",SPHttpClient.configurations.v1).then(res=>{}

23.sp.web.currentuser.get().then(res=>{})

24. For success/error message we can use Notify("Request deleted",NotificationType.Success); function. It has four type as success, error, information, warning.

25. Community Site does nt have left navigation but it has top navigation. Modern team has left navigation but not top navigatio.
Community sites external sharing is disabled but in team site it is enabled.
Site Owner/member and visitor are by default created for both but Office 365 group is created only for team site.

26.on first page, Navigate(editscreen, {itemtopass:gallery.selected.id})
On edit screen, bind edit screen form with datasource list(EG), then for item of edit form First(Filter(EG, Id=itemtopass))

27. Get context information for the current site collection?
import { sp } from "@pnp/sp";
import "@pnp/sp/sites";
import { IContextInfo } from "@pnp/sp/sites";
const oContext: IContextInfo = await sp.site.getContextInfo();
console.log(oContext.FormDigestValue);

28. Check if a Site Collection Exists?
import { sp } from "@pnp/sp";
// Specify which site to verify
const siteUrl = "https://tenant.sharepoint.com/sites/subsite";
const exists = sp.site.exists(siteUrl);
console.log(exists);

29. Retrieving Lookup Fields
import { sp } from "@pnp/sp";
import "@pnp/sp/webs";
import "@pnp/sp/lists";
import "@pnp/sp/items";
const items = await sp.web.lists.getByTitle("LookupList").items.select("Title", "Lookup/Title", "Lookup/ID").expand("Lookup").get();
console.log(items);

30. Add Multiple Items in List using Batch
import { sp } from "@pnp/sp";
import "@pnp/sp/webs";
import "@pnp/sp/lists";
import "@pnp/sp/items";

let list = sp.web.lists.getByTitle("rapidadd");
const entityTypeFullName = await list.getListItemEntityTypeFullName()
let batch = sp.web.createBatch();
list.items.inBatch(batch).add({ Title: "Batch 6" }, entityTypeFullName).then(b => {
  console.log(b);
});
list.items.inBatch(batch).add({ Title: "Batch 7" }, entityTypeFullName).then(b => {
  console.log(b);
});

await batch.execute();
console.log("Done");

31. Use PnP JS To Fetch List Items From Other Site Collection?
private web = Web("https://testinglala.sharepoint.com/sites/Test/");  
public componentDidMount = () => {  
    this.web.lists.getByTitle("Employee").items().then((items) => {  
        this.setState({  
            listItems: items  
        });  
    }).catch((err) => {  
        console.log(err);  
    });  
}

32. How to make Pnp function async in spfx framework?
function GetServiceListData():Promise<any>  
{ 
    return pnp.sp.web.lists.getByTitle('Test').items
        .select('Title,FullName,DOJ,ManagerName/Title')
        .expand('ManagerName')
        .get();
}
function successCallback(response){
    //do things with response in a callback
}
function errorCallback(error){
    //handle error
}
//usage
GetServiceListData()
    .then(successCallback)
    .catch(errorCallback);

33. Use delegation
Delegation is a mechanism to access all data from a data source in a performance friendly manner.All results are fetched in a maximum of 100 items bundles. The next bundle is being fetched once a user scroll to the end of a gallery/table list.Collections are not supported and works under non-delegable queries limitation (Collect() or ClearCollect() functions breaks delegation!)

34. Include "supportsFullBleed": true, in *.manifest.json file to support full width of SPFX.

35. REST api takes list display name for api call, _spPageContextInfo.webabsoluteUrl+"/_api/web/list/getByTitle('List Display Name')/items?$select='Title'"

36. Creating A Custom Component In Power Apps
Many times as a developer we face a situation where we have to repeat functionality across a form multiple times. For a simple example let us assume that a combination of Textbox, Label and button is required on multiple places inside the form. Most of the time, we keep inserting 3 controls every time we require the combination. Although Power Apps provides us option to select the controls and paste it in multiple places in the form, but that is not the best practice. The best way to go forward would be to create a custom component and use it every time the combination (Textbox, Label and button) is required. Below is the step by step way for creating a custom component in Power Apps and how to use that component in multiple places inside the Power Apps form.

37. Create custom button in list item action in modern list view?
a. Create an XML file and save as below in local path.
<pnp:ProvisioningTemplate ID="EditControlBlockSamples" Version="1" xmlns:pnp="http://schemas.dev.office.com/PnP/2015/12/ProvisioningSchema">
  <pnp:CustomActions>
    <pnp:SiteCustomActions>
      <pnp:CustomAction Name="CA_1" Description="ca 1" Location="EditControlBlock" RegistrationType="List" RegistrationId="101" Title="CA 1 Title" Sequence="3000" Url="https://contoso.azurewebsites.net/pages/index.aspx" Enabled="true"/>
      <pnp:CustomAction Name="CA_2" Description="ca 2" Location="EditControlBlock" RegistrationType="ContentType" RegistrationId="0x0101" Title="CA 2 Title" Sequence="4000" Url="https://contoso.azurewebsites.net/pages/index.aspx" Enabled="true"/>
    </pnp:SiteCustomActions>
  </pnp:CustomActions>
</pnp:ProvisioningTemplate>
b. Now run the bwlow powershell script
# Connect to a previously created Modern Site
$cred = Get-Credential
Connect-PnPOnline -Url https://[tenant].sharepoint.com/sites/siteurl -Credentials $cred

# Apply the PnP provisioning template
Apply-PnPProvisioningTemplate -Path c:\customaction_modern_editcontrolblock.xml -Handlers CustomActions

38. Similarly we can do Command ribbon button in list/library?
<pnp:ProvisioningTemplate ID="CommandUIRibbonSamples" Version="1" xmlns:pnp="http://schemas.dev.office.com/PnP/2015/12/ProvisioningSchema">
  <pnp:CustomActions>
    <pnp:SiteCustomActions>
      <pnp:CustomAction Name="CA_4" Description="ca 4" Location="CommandUI.Ribbon" RegistrationType="List" RegistrationId="101" Title="CA 4 Title" Sequence="6000" Enabled="true">
        <pnp:CommandUIExtension>
<CommandUIDefinitions>
        <CommandUIDefinition Location="Ribbon.Documents.Copies.Controls._children">
          <Button
            Id="Ribbon.Documents.Copies.OfficeDevPnPDownloadAll"
            Command="OfficeDevPnP.Cmd.DownloadAll"
            Image16by16="/_layouts/15/images/sharepointfoundation16.png"
            LabelText="Download All"
            Description="Download all files separately"
            ToolTipTitle="Download All"
            ToolTipDescription="Download all files separately"
            TemplateAlias="o1"
            Sequence="15"/>
        </CommandUIDefinition>
      </CommandUIDefinitions>
      <CommandUIHandlers>
        <CommandUIHandler
          Command="OfficeDevPnP.Cmd.DownloadAll"
          CommandAction="https://contoso.azurewebsites.net/pages/index.aspx" />
      </CommandUIHandlers>
    </pnp:CommandUIExtension>
      </pnp:CustomAction>
    </pnp:SiteCustomActions>
  </pnp:CustomActions>
</pnp:ProvisioningTemplate>

47. How to trigger flow from SP list or page?
We can create current button in SharePoint list view. Steps- Create sinle line column > Then Format this column > Provide JSON input.

48. Form control by default have New, View and Edit mode.

49. SPFX extension has bydefault OnInit method where we can get this.context.placeholderProvider.placeholderNames and can apply condition as if (!this._topPlaceholder) {} and by using this.context.placeholderProvider.tryCreateContent(PlaceholderName.Top)

50. Pass parameter from parent to child in react?
In Parent
<Child2 dataFromParent = {this.state.data} />
In Child
return (
            <div>
                The data from parent is:{this.props.dataFromParent}
            </div>
        );

51. From Child to Parent Using Callbacks?
In Parent:
state = { message: "" }
callbackFunction = (childData) => {
      this.setState({message: childData})
},
render() {
        return (
            <div>
                 <Child1 parentCallback = {this.callbackFunction}/>
                 <p> {this.state.message} </p>
            </div>
        );
}
}
In Child:
sendData = () => {
         this.props.parentCallback("Hey Popsie, How’s it going?");
    },
render() { 
//you can call function sendData whenever you'd like to send data from child component to Parent component.
    }

52. Use Context api to share data between?
Step1 : Pass the state and the callback function as props to all children inside the Provider Component.
export const MContext = React.createContext();  //exporting context object
class MyProvider extends Component {
state = {message: ""}
render() {
        return (
            <MContext.Provider value={
            {   state: this.state,
                setMessage: (value) => this.setState({
                            message: value })}}>
            {this.props.children}   //this indicates that the global store is accessible to all the child tags with MyProvider as Parent
            </MContext.Provider>)
    }
}

Step2 : Use MyProvider component as a Parent to the two children — Child1, Child2.
render() {
        return (
            <div>
                 <MyProvider>
                      <div className="App">
                      <Child1/>
                      <Child2/>
                      </div>
               </MyProvider>
            </div>
        );
}
Step 3: Implement the desired result in the same manner, but this time, using ContextObject.Consumer
render() {
    return (
        <div>
        <Mcontext.Consumer>
        {(context) => (
       <button onClick={()=>{context.setMessage("New Arrival")}}>Send</button>
       )}
        </Mcontext.Consumer>
        </div>
    ) }
Now we can accessing the Provider withing Consumer tags

Q. React Life cycle method?
Mounting:These methods are called in the following order when an instance of a component is being created and inserted into the DOM:
constructor()
static getDerivedStateFromProps()
render()
componentDidMount()
Updating:An update can be caused by changes to props or state. These methods are called in the following order when a component is being re-rendered:
static getDerivedStateFromProps()
shouldComponentUpdate()
render()
getSnapshotBeforeUpdate()
componentDidUpdate()
Unmounting:This method is called when a component is being removed from the DOM:
componentWillUnmount()

Q. Error Handling?These methods are called when there is an error during rendering, in a lifecycle method, or in the constructor of any child component.
static getDerivedStateFromError()
componentDidCatch()

Q. SPFX React Component Lifecycle methods:
OnInit-This is the start method of the web part.
Render method : This method is called to render the final HTML based on state change. We can include some switch logic or call html rendering functions.
ComponentWillMount – This method is called before the render method every time the control is loaded or refreshed.
ComponentDidMount – This method is called after the render method every time the control is loaded or refreshed. The code related to pre-population of controls could be placed here.
ComponentDidUpdate – This method is called every time a Property or State is updated. Based on the update and if anything has changed, the implementation code could be run.

    this.clientContext.executeQueryAsync(Function.createDelegate(this,this.onQuerySucceeded),
    
Q. Yaml Pipeline structure(It contains multiple stages and tasks as follows)
YAML Pipeline > Stages > Jobs > Script/Task
Every Jobs require an Microsoft Hosted Agent or self hosted Agent(VM).

Q. Pipeline Stages:
A pipeline is made of one or more stages. A stage is way of organising jobs in a pipeline and each stage can have one or more jobs.
Stages:
-stage:string #name of the stage
 displayname: string
 dependsOn: string
 condition: string
 pool: string
 variable: string
 jobs: [job]
 
 Q. Jobs: A jobs in Pipeline is a collection of one or more steps.
 jobs:
 -Job:string
 displayname:string
 condition:string
 variables:strin
 steps:[script|powershell|task|templatereference]
 Example:
 Jobs:
 -Job:Debug
   Steps:
   -script:echo hello world from debug
 -Job:Release
   DependsOn:Debug
   Steps:
    -script:echo hello world from Release
    
 
Q. Agents:
 Each jobs inside an azure pipeline is executed on an agent. An agent is an installable software that runs one job at a time.
 There are two types of agents:
 -Self Hosted- Owned and managed by you. Gives you more control to install dependant packages for build and packages.
 -Microsoft Hosted- MS provides fresh VM every time a job needs to run.
 
Q. Templates: It lets you define reusable content, logic and parameters.
--Defining a custom template
#File :simple-param.yml
parameters:
    -name:yesNo #name of parameter to be used in other file
    type:boolean
    default:false
    
    steps:
    -script:echo ${{parameters.yesNo}}

--Using a custom template defined earlier
#File :azure-pipeline.yml
trigger:
 -master
 
extends:
 template: simple-param.yml
 parameters:
    yesNo:true #setting up the parameter value defined earlier
 
Q. Office 365 E5 Developer Subscription is created when we create Developer Account in Office 365.

Q. SP Batch Command in SharePoint?
We can create Batch command and tag multiple request as series inside wrapper.

  const list = sp.web.lists.getByTitle('MyCustomList');
  const ent = await list.getListItemEntityTypeFullName();
  const batch = pnp.sp.web.createBatch();
  const items = list.items.inBatch(batch);

  items.add({ Title: 'Item 1' }, ent).catch(console.warn);
  items.add({ Title: 'Item 2' }, ent).catch(console.warn);

  await batch.execute();
  console.log('Done');
  
Q. Apply Top and order By in SPFX PNP
// get a specific item by id.
const item: any = await sp.web.lists.getByTitle("My List").items.getById(1).get();
console.log(item);

// use odata operators for more efficient queries
const items2: any[] = await sp.web.lists.getByTitle("My List").items.select("Title", "Description").top(5).orderBy("Modified", false).get();//latest on top
console.log(items2);

Q. Search Api and Rest API in SharePoint
Selecting all items, all columns
/_api/web/lists/getbytitle('listname')/Items?$select=*
Note that I said “almost”, because SharePoint’s REST API doesn’t really bring back everything. Things such as author information and values of lookups have to be queried differently (more on this below).

Getting the total items in a list
/_api/web/lists/getbytitle('listName')/ItemCount

Retrieving specific list items
/_api/web/lists/getbytitle('listname')/items(4)
or
/_api/web/lists/getbytitle('listname')/Items?$select=Title&$filter=Title eq 'example 1'

Multiple or filter values
/_api/web/lists/getbytitle('listname')/Items?$select=Title&$filter=((Title eq 'example 1') or (Title eq 'example 2'))

Multiple or/And filter
/_api/web/lists/getbytitle('ListName')/Items?$&$select=Title&$filter=((ContentType eq 'Operating Policy') or (ContentType eq 'Procedure')) and (Subject eq 'Safety')

Using “startswith()” and “substringof()” functions with $filter
At times you need a more powerful filter in SharePoint REST API. See “eq” will only retrieve exact matches. If you want to get everything that starts with “test”, you use the “startswith()” function:

/_api/web/lists/getbytitle('ListName')/Items?$filter=((startswith(column,'test')))

if you want to get items that “contains” specific characters, you use the “substringof()” function.
/_api/web/lists/getbytitle('ListName')/Items?$filter=((substringof('test',column)))

The $top parameter basically limits your items to a specified number.
/_api/web/lists/getbytitle('listname')/Items?$select=Title&$top=10

Offsetting results
/_api/web/lists/getbytitle('listname')/Items?$top='10'&$skip='20'

Getting the Author Information
/_api/web/lists/getbytitle('listname')/Items?$select=Author/Title,Comment&$expand=Author/Title

Document Libraries
/_api/web/lists/getbytitle('Document Library Name')/Items?$select=Title,FileLeafRef,EncodedAbsThumbnailUrl,EncodedAbsUrl
The example above returns information about your file such as the name, full url and the internal “Title”

For instances where you want to know the “type” of document library it is (example Picture Library vs Document Library), use:
/_api/web/lists/getbytitle('Document Library Name')/BaseTemplate

To Get items inside subfolder
/_api/web/GetFolderByServerRelativeUrl('"ParentFolder Name/sub Folder"')/Files

Getting Current User information
/_api/SP.UserProfiles.PeopleManager/GetMyProperties
or
/_api/web/currentUser

Getting Current User Groups
/_api/web/GetUserById('"+ userId +"')/Groups

SharePoint Search API
/_api/search/query?querytext='"+ TERM +"'
The results are buried under: data.d.query.PrimaryQueryResult.RelevantResults.Table.Rows.results

Selecting specific Properties
/_api/search/query?querytext='"+ TERM +"'&selectproperties='Title,Path,FileExtension,IsContainer'

Offsetting Results (for paging)
For instances where you want to return the set of rows that starts from a specific number:
/_api/search/query?querytext='"+ TERM +"'&startrow=10

Limiting Results
You don’t want to return everything! You simply want to limit your search:
/_api/search/query?querytext='"+ TERM +"'&rowlimit=25

Only Results from a Specific List or Document Library
/_api/search/query?querytext='"+ TERM +"'&sourceid='YOUR-LIST-ID'

Filtering Results
Sometimes you don’t want the whole resultset to comeback. This is where filtering comes in. SharePoint Search API has “refinement filters” which does the job.
/_api/search/query?querytext='TERM'&refinementfilters='(FIELD:string("FILTERTERM", mode="phrase")'
The above will search for “TERM”, filtered with the “FILTERTERM”  in the field called “FIELD”.

Filtering Results in Multiple Fields
So now we need to filter by many fields. Yes it’s possible, and we still use “refinement filters” in the Search API.
/_api/search/query?querytext='TERM'&refinementfilters='and(COL1:string("COL1TERM", mode="phrase"),COL2:string("COL2TERM", mode="phrase"))'
Just like the single filter, but instead we add “and” in the beginning (you can also use “or”), plus separating the columns and terms with a comma.

Sorting Results
/_api/search/query?querytext='TERM'&sortlist='LastName:ascending,FirstName:ascending'
